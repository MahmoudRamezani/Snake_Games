# Snake_Games
In this repository, three different snake games have been written in python. The main 
aim is to try some heuristic functions in reinforcement learning.

There are three python scripts here

 simpleSnake.py is the simple snake game that you can play with arrow keys of the keyboard
 
Snake_AI.py is a more complicated version of the snake game in which the AI player is playing 
with the chosen heuristic function.

Snake_AI_multiple.py is the most complicated one here in which we add some random blocked area
for the AI player and it must avoide colliding with them. 

In each python script, I started with a brief overview of what the code is for. Also, whenever 
something is necessary to be mentioned for you, it is inserted as comments along with the code.
